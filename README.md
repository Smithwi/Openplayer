OpenAL Soft can be configured on a per-user and per-system basis. This allows
users and sysadmins to control information provided to applications, as well
as application-agnostic behavior of the library. 



Please Note

 Often, complaints of no sound, crashing, and missing devices can be solved by making 
sure the correct backends are being used. CMake's output will identify which 
backends were enabled.
